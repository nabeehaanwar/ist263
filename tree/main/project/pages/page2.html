        <p>Might be a hot take, but rainy days in college can be some of the best days. Sometimes, it can be so relaxing and set the perfect scene for studying, so I would definitely light a candle, find a place near a big window, and enjoy the ambience of the drizzling against your window. And what better thing is there to do besides sit back and watch a movie? Rainy days were made for movies and especially for murder mysteries. Whatever you do, don’t let the gloomy weather get you down, instead, use it to your advantage! </p>

        <p>We all have those moments of missing home in the first few weeks of the semester, and it always sucks. Take this time to retreat back into your younger self, do everything the younger you always said you would and live out your best life in college! Don’t hesitate to call or video chat your parents, your hometown friends, or a loved one or even write them a couple of ‘Open When’ letters to spread a little bit of that happiness in your life. No matter what, make sure you give yourself time to deal with that feeling, have a self-care day, indulge in some of your favorite foods, put on a couple of face masks, pursue some new hobbies, and keep yourself going.</p>
